# ProPresenter-vMix

Uses the ProPresenter Stage Display network API to feed current slide text into a vMix text input for lower thirds.

This was quickly written one morning before service, and still needs some serious cleanup. Please ready through the comments in the code to see what info needs changed to match your environment.

For this to work, the lower third text input in vMix has to be selected in the Preview window. IF another input is selected, the text will not update. I haven't had time to look into fixing this.
